# Algorithms
A collection of C++ algorithms I wrote or found on the interwebz. Feel free to use them! :D

During my programming journey I came across a lot of algorithms, oftentimes overcomplicated. Usually those can
be written in a much better way (ex. all those stupid versions of bubblesort, you know that feeling right?). I try my best o provide useful and easy to understand implementations of different algorithms in the C++ language by either modifying existing ones or sorting out the best among all the noise. If you spot errors point them out please!

Here a picture of a cat pretending to be a tortilla:
