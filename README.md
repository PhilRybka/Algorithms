# Algorithms
A collection of C++ algorithms I wrote, tweaked or found somewhere on the interwebz with the aid of this guy . MIT Licence applies to all! :D

During my programming journey I came across a lot of different versions of algorithms. Very often they are overcomplicated and can
be written in a cleaner and shorter way. I try my best o provide useful and easy to understand implementations of different algorithms in the C++ language by either modifying existing ones or sorting out the best among all the noise. Take a look around, hope you'll find some of them useful!
