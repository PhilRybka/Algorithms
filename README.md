# Algorithms
A collection of C++ algorithms I wrote, tweaked or found somewhere on the interwebz. Feel free to use them! :D

During my programming journey I came across a lot of algorithms, very often overcomplicated and can
be written in a much better way (ex. all those stupid versions of bubblesort, you know that feeling right?). I try my best o provide useful and easy to understand implementations of different algorithms in the C++ language by either modifying existing ones or sorting out the best among all the noise. Take a look around, hope you'll find some of them useful!  If you spot errors point them out please!
