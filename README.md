# Algorithms
A collection of C++ algorithms I wrote, tweaked or found somewhere. MIT Licence applies to all! :D

During my programming journey I came across a lot of different versions of algorithms. Very often they are overcomplicated and can
be written in a cleaner and shorter way. I try my best o provide useful and easy to understand versions of different algorithms
by either modifying existing ones or sorting out the best among all the noise. Take a look around! ;)
